Deal flow:

A Lotus client starts a deal [`ClientStartDeal`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/35759fa07e109a310006c98c9b90117be2c61507/node/impl/client/client.go#L99).

This calls [`ProposeStorageDeal`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-fil-markets/blob/55c09b0205f49ac9fe32a1030135757143fb1711/storagemarket/impl/client.go#L330) in `go-fil-markets`.

It sends the proposal CID to the peer and "tracks" it.

The send is given an ID (the proposal CID) and an event name "ClientEventOpen"

The proposal CID is returned...then what?

[Lots of other states establishing deal](https://spec.filecoin.io/#figure-storage-market-deal-flow).

Eventually the proivider (server) will transition to the `ProviderEventDataTransferCompleted` state.

Maybe we can subscribe to that event and then pull the CID...?

[StorageProvider is setup here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/35759fa07e109a310006c98c9b90117be2c61507/node/modules/storageminer.go#L569).

Deal flow integration tests (`api/test/deals.go`) are run from `node/node_test.go`

Run the deal flow tests:

```sh
go test -v ./node/... -run TestAPIDealFlowReal
```
