## niftysave (ETH NFT scraper -> nft.storage)

### Design

This could all be run as lambdas, giving us "unbounded" parallelism so we can get NFTs stored asap.

For content already on IPFS, the plan is to lean on pinning service API, allowing Pinata/IPFS to find and pin content asynchronously. We periodically check and record completion, and re-submit on failure.

Content that is available via means other than IPFS is also fetched and added. TODO: what is the story here - how do folks then find their data on IPFS? One idea: MFS directory with predictable domain mapped paths `/ipns/nft.storage/https/niftygateway/com/path/to/nft.jpg`.

#### Processes

* ChaiNFT λ
    * Inspects a chain between 2 epochs, finds NFTs and returns info about them.
    * Chain type (ETH), offset & limit (max 100)
* StorProc λ
    * Accepts a link to something storable, like a URL, a CID, whatever, and attempts to store it on nft.storage.
    * This will likely be using the pinning service API so success may not be instant.
    * Returns CID and pin status.
* Vinyl λ
    * Records information and pin status for assets of an NFT.
    * Create logs existence and expected followup calls.
    * Update changes pin status.
    * Can write to KV or PostgreSQL or whatever.
* Followup λ + ⏰λ
    * Register for periodic checks to ensure a CID eventually gets pinned.
    * API simply accepts and stores a CID+NFTID to check.
    * Cron:
        * For each cid...
            * Get pinning status from nft.storage.
            * Call Vinyl if changed.
            * If failed, resubmit.
            * Update last check time and resubmit count.
            * If too old or too resubmitted then call Vinyl to log perma-fail.
* Orch ⏰λ
    * Manages scraping and initial storing.
    * Call ChaiNFT from last epoch to current epoch.
        * Limit 100 epochs per "page"
        * For each NFT...
            * Call Vinyl to log existence.
            * Extract storable links.
            * For each link.
                * Call StorProc.
                * Call Vinyl to update pin status for asset.
                * Call Followup iff asset is not already pinned.
* Promulgate λ + ⏰λ
    * Periodic recounts of metrics, totals cached in KV store.
    * Exposes prometheus metrics endpoint.

### Questions to answer

1. Total size of NFT data?
1. Total number of NFTs?
1. Current stored data size?
1. Current number of NFTs stored?
1. Total missing/broken NFTs
1. Total NFTs by storage provider e.g.
    * IPFS / Filecoin
    * Arweave
    * URL
        * Google drive etc.
1. Number of NFTs by marketplace?
1. Number of NFTs using metadata standard ERC-721 / ERC-1155 / other
1. Rate of new NFTs vs rate of storage on nft.storage (will we catch up?)

### Nice Ideas

* Dashboard for scrape progress (is this just a Grafana?)
* Gitub activity wall for stored NFTs
* MFS directory for content at URLs /ipfs/{cid}/https/nifygateway/com/path/to/nft.jpg
