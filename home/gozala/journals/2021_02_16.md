## DONE Did bunch of changes to [[Symbiosis protocol]] pitch.

## DONE Had team call where I got feedback on current state of [[Symbiosis protocol]] _(previously [[Symbiotic network]])_ pitch

### Name "[[symbiotic network]]" leaves a wrong impression
### [[Symbiosis protocol]] needs a list of capabilities host nodes will share with symbiont to give better idea of the scope
### Feature comparison table to better illustrate gaps, with columns for
#### embedded ipfs
#### ipfs client
#### symbiont
## Got feedback from [[@momack2]] on [[Symbiosis protocol]] proposal
### Think about this related to remote IPFS nodes
### üëç "0 cost to switch backing node"
## Collaborated  with [[@hugomrdias]] on [[Symbiosis protocol]]
### DONE Added bunch of new examples to illustrate different use cases so it is not leaving impression of just browser nodes leveraging [[IPFS Desktop]].

### In an attempt to clarify `symbiont <-> host` protocol, I recognized similarity to [[DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD)]] and decided to reframe everything through those lens.
### Renamed proposal to [[symbiosis protocol]]
## Discussions with [[@hugomrdias]] on how current signaling infrastructure leads to network fragmentation, led us towards [[Distributed signaling]] subject.
### We have decided to start a new project proposal for it.
## Me and [[@hugomrdias]] have decided to submit [[Reliable Mutability Primitive]] ~~IPNS project~~  pitch as is & work on improving it inside a PR.
