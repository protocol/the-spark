# JS Bug triage

# Talked to [[fission]] about [[Unified FileSystem API]] to find out if would be useful to them & if we could make encryption & their custom encoding pluggable
## There is a skepticism that API could be generalized enough to cover wide range of use cases across ([[Fission]], [[Textile]] and  [[Peergos]]) and be practical.
## [[@expede]] offered to have a call in an attempt to specify an interface and see how practical it could be.
## Per my request I was given a pointer to general overview of [[fission]] [[WebNative FileSystem]]

# Discussions in triage prompted me the create [slack thread](https://protocollabs.slack.com/archives/CHPA2EMG8/p1613669048106700) to sync [[@vmx]] and [[@achingbrain]] on the proposed plan for integrating new [[js-multiformats]] into [[js-ipfs]]
