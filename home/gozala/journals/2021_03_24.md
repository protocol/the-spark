### Recommending use of `ipfs://${cid}` not only addresses issues with gateway links but also drives a wider recognition of such URLs
### We could reduce `ipfs://` URL resolution friction by adopting `https://gateway.link/ipfs://bafybeiabis2rrk6m3p7xghz42hi677ectmzqxsvz26icxxs7digddgpbr4/` style URLs on  gateways.
### Given [[ipfs protocol registration]] support, it would make sense to start a project to deploy [[protocol registration on gateways]].
### We should recommend embedding list of known content providers, as opposed to gateway link(s). Addresses in the list should no include asset CID, but just a address to the gateway that can provide it.
