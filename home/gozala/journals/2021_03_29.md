## Test coverage for [[nft.storage client]]
### https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/nft.storage/issues/49
### 
> You can run the same [[nyc]] 100% cmd in the output of playwright-test cov output
[[@hugomrdias]]
###
> With ESM you can’t use [[nyc]]. You have to use [[c8]] I have a package called [[hundreds]] which is just a shell script that wraps the command in the very long c8 command with all the right flags

###
> [[playwright-test]] does the cov gathering, [[nyc]] is just for the rest. What I have in [[aegir]] c8 for node, pw-test for browser. I'm currently working to have the pw-test cov output be 100% compatible with c8, so we can do the 100% check with just c8 for everything

## Proposed to bake IPFS content addressing best practice into [[CID]]s
###
```ts
interface CID {
  // ... stuff we already have
  /**
   * Encodes CID into a URL object.
   *
   * @example
   * ```js
   * const cid = CID.parse('QmbrRJJNKmPDUAZ8CGwn1WNx2C7xP4J284VWoAUDaCiLaD')
   * cid.toURL().href // 'ipfs://bafybeigizayotjo4whdurcq6ge7nrgfyxox7ji7oviesmnvgrnxn3nakni/'
   * ```
   * 
   * Optionally you could provide a gateway URL to encode CID to a URL in that gateway.
   * @example
   * ```js
   * const cid = CID.parse('QmbrRJJNKmPDUAZ8CGwn1WNx2C7xP4J284VWoAUDaCiLaD')
   * cid.toURL().href // 'https://bafybeigizayotjo4whdurcq6ge7nrgfyxox7ji7oviesmnvgrnxn3nakni.ipfs.dweb.link/'
   * ```
   */
  toURL(options?: { gateway?: URL }):URL
}
```

### 1. `ipfs://${cidv1}` is the default that we want to see.
### 2. We want to encourage CID v1 because it addresses bunch of issues that we have with v0.
### 3. Gateways URLs are origin separated by default.
## Considered idea of turning [[CID]] into [URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL) subclass
### Was hoping they would be cross thread cloneable. Instead got `Uncaught DOMException: The object could not be cloned.`
## Proposed content addressing with prominence `ipfs://${CIDv1}`
