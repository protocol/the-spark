## DONE Created [[EIP-721]] subgraph from  [wighawag/eip721-subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/wighawag/eip721-subgraph) in order to include block number and hash.
:PROPERTIES:
:now: 1618531744308
:done: 1618531745812
:END:
## [[chain scanner]] can pull data from the [[EIP-721]] subgraph
### On time based schedule it will query subgraph to update own state with last block `number` and `hash`
###
```graphql
{
  chain: _meta {
    block {
      number
      hash
    }
  }
}
```
### Will perform atomic state update. I do not know if cloudfare has a way to do consistent state, if not we could use database table, although that seems a bit overkill. I think in worst case scenario we might just experience concurrency issue and end up with not fully up to date record, but doesn't seem like a big deal on next run things should get resolved.
## [[token scanner]] will maintain a cursor to keep track of which `block` and which token it is on.
### It will pull next 100 tokens (or less) via query

```graphq
{
  tokens(
   first: 100
	where:{
  	  tokenURI_not: ""
      blockNumber: $cursorBlock
      id_gt: $cursorToken
    }
  ) {
    id
    tokenID
    tokenURI
    mintTime
    contract {
      id
      name
      symbol
    }
    owner {
      id
    }
  }
}
```
### Discovered tokens will be added into DB table

|id|token|uri|block|no|mintTime|contract|name|symbol|owner|
|--|-----|---|------|--|----------|---------|------|-------|------|
### It will attempt to fetch `tokenURI`, which should hold `metadata.json`. And if so it will archive content into IPFS and record that into **metadata** table.

|id|uri|cid|time|
|--|---|---|----|
#### This does seem to overlap with [[StorProc]] so maybe it should delegate this task to it instead ?
### It will record all the linked assets from the metadata into **assets** table.
## [[token analyzer]] will insert linked resources into **assets** table

|id|uri|
|--|--|
## [[token analyzer]] will also have a side table to store failed
