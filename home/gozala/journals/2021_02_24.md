## JS Core office hours
### We have a table with [TS task list](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/2945) to get it over the finish line.
#### TODO Integrate new aegir into [ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap#261](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap/pull/261)
#### LATER Write a proposal for scheduler that can work across sync/async APIs
## We should figure out a way of integrating outside work into our stack
### How do we enable integrating things like [[WebNative Filesystem]] so it is first class citizen ?
#### If browsers ship IPFS natively and it does not work with [[WebNative FileSystem]] we create a competition.
#### LATER Should write a proposal illustrating that **encrypted data support is essential for web3**.
#### DONE Write a proposal for implementing remote pinning API.

## Another pass on [[Reliable Mutability Primitive]] proposal

### Me and [[@hugomrdias]] attempted to capture current state of [[IPNS]] *(across supported environments and strategies)*, but found ourselves with [bunch of questions that we were not able to answer](https://hackmd.io/kKBphQ1xS1uBpwtfnnZfuA).
### Started [[IPNS]] [discussion thread on slack](https://protocollabs.slack.com/archives/CDWAJ81FA/p1614201553046400)
### Scheduled a call with [[@aschmahmann]] and [[@vasco]] to go over the questions with them and attempt to document current state of interop across supported environments  *(go, node and web IPFS nodes)*.
### It became clear that multiple strategies for addressing mutability do not fit one proposal so we decided to break it apart
### Drafted new [[Fast lane IPNS]] proposal.
