# February 18



- JS Bug triage
- Talked to fission.codes about [Unified FileSystem API][] to find out if would be useful to them & if we could make encryption & their custom encoding pluggable.
  - There is a skepticism that API could be generalized enough to cover wide range of use cases across (Fission, Textile and  Peergos) and be practical.
  - @expede offered to have a call in an attempt to specify an interface and see how practical it could be.
  - Per my request I was given a pointer to general overview of fission FileSystem

- Discussions in triage prompted me the create [slack thread][multiformats sync thread] to sync @vmx and @achingbrain on the proposed plan for integrating new `@multiformats` into `js-ipfs`.
- Going through github inbox (issues, pull requests, etc...)
  - Connected  [ipfs/js-ipfs#3541][] with [Distributed signaling][] project proposal.
  - Tried to clarify how [Distributed signaling][] is different from [Project Flare][]
  - Provided feedback for [Reliable resolution of human-readable names][] proposal.
  - ðŸ˜°So much stuff to go over...
- Reviewing [Project Flare][] proposal.
  - Provided pointer to [hyperswarm][] library which does hole punching.
