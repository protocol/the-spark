#### üí≠Services in [Symbiosis Protocol][]

- It would be cool to use [IPLD Schema][] and [IPLD Selectors][] to describe services, but I came to recognize that my prior thinking of specifying service via `{ state: State, inbox: Inbox }` has major limitations.
  - Say service exposes something like [`/api/v0/block/put`][] of IPFS HTTP API, where you upload some content and get a `CID` back. It would be really inconvenient if you had to figure out the CID by querying state after you've send `BlockPut` message to inbox.
  - [GraphQL][] does not have that problem because `Mutatitons`have an [argument][GraphQL Argument] and a schema for a result.
  - It is not clear to me how would you go about expressing something like that with [IPLD Schema][]
- Given current maturity level of [IPLD Schema][] and [IPLD Selectors][] and limitation described above, I'm leaning towards describing service interface as a DAG of [GraphQL Schema][] AST.
  - However schemas are likely to evolve over time, implying that CID of the schema may be a poor way to identify the protocol because extended protocol is likely going to be compatible with an old protocol but nodes won't be aware.
  - On the other hard nothing stops host from announcing both schemas, which may in fact be better guarantee that host talks an older protocol  version.
  - Still seems like it might be beneficial to express that one protocol extends the other, maybe simply a link to prior revision might be a good idea.
  - IPNS would have been a great way to go about it. Oh well, thing at a time.
- It is becoming more clear to me that hosts may want to differentiate between **local** and **global** services.
  - IPFS host like IPFS Desktop may provide pinning service, relay service, routing service, ‚Ä¶etc to the nodes on local network only.
  - Some other services like `DNSLink` record update may be provided by a host like fission.codes.
- üí°For the proof of concept it may make more sense to use [ipfsd-ctl][] for the host as opposed to doing prototyping in Go. Implementation in go can made afterwards.

#### üßê Looking into [UCAN][]

#### ‚ö°Ô∏èWrote [Enable PubSub][] Pitch

- Talked to Fission to ensure I did not misrepresent
- [Discussed with team on slack][pubsub-discuss]

#### üßê Reviewing Textile's Thread DIDs

- Textile team pointed out that "symbiosis protocol" has some overlap with [Thread DID discussion][]
- Read through, but I feel like I need few more passes before I can fully grasp it.
