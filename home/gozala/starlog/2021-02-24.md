# February 24

##### JS Core office hours

- We have a table with [TS task list][] to get it over the finish line.
  - [ ] Integrate new aegir into [ipfs/js-ipfs-bitswap#261][]
  - [ ] Write a proposal for scheduler that can work across sync/async APIs
- We should figure out a way of integrating outside work into our stack
  - How do we enable integrating things like `WebNativeFilesystem` so it is first class citizen ?
  - If browsers ship IPFS natively and it does not work with `WebNativeFileSystem` we create a competition.
- I should write a proposal illustrating that encrypted data support is essential for web3.
- [x] Write a proposal for implementing remote pinning API.

##### Another pass on [Reliable Mutability Primitive][] proposal

- Me and @hugomrdias attempted to capture current state of IPNS *(across supported environments and strategies)*, but found ourselves with [bunch of questions that we were not able to answer][].
- Started [discussion thread on slack][ipns discussion thread]
- Scheduled a call with @aschmahmann and @vasco to go over the questions with them and attempt to document current state of interop across supported environments  *(go, node and web IPFS nodes)*.
- It became clear that multiple strategies for addressing mutability do not fit one proposal so we decided to break it apart
- Drafted new [Fast lane IPNS][] proposal.
