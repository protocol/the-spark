## Notes/Questions

Using Pinata for `nft.storage`:

- Pinata can't announce millions of DHT records fast enough before they expire.
- Matt asked if PL clusters announce millions of records?
- Do we need dedicated gateway?
    - No
- We can choose number of replication per content 1 to 50.
- What if we get more traffic than this can handle?
    - Matt recomends cluster of 3 nodes, which is probably going to be overkill.
    - Could be setup with 1 terabyte per node.
    - We can setup regular pinata account.
    - We can limit to 5gigs of storage per user.
- API wrapper things.
    - Provision API key per user & only limit it to upload.
    - We need to provide matt with our gateway node multiaddrs.
