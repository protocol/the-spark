# The Spark Planning 2021-04-12

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

## Async Updates

@alanshaw
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Updated the planning meeting template
    - Working on storing ALL the NFTs on nft.storage. [niftysave](https://github.com/nftstorage/niftysave) is the project that does this. I have implemented workers:
        - **StorProc** (store an asset on nft.storage)
        - **Vinyl** (record found NFTs and their assets to a database)
        - **Followup** (make sure NFT assets eventually pinned and record status updates)
        - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nftstorage/niftysave/main/diagram.png" alt="Diagram of niftysave architecture." />
- ⛔️ Blocked:
- ⏭ Next:
    - Implement remainder of [niftysave workers](https://github.com/nftstorage/niftysave)

@gozala
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Backend implementation of `/api/store`
        - Turns out cloudfare ignores port in the address that caused us to waste lot of time before we figured out the issue.
        - We don't have a good way of figuring out when pinata got the content from our node.
            - We could probably upload files to pinata as well and assuming same chunking CIDs should come out same.
            - Seems like a scheduled task that occasionally checks status on pinata would be better though.
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - ~~Our IPFS node is not reachable by the network~~
- ⏭ Next:
    - Help with data ingestion ?
    - At some point we should really create pinning service 2.0. proposal. So clients isn't required to be full IPFS node.


@hugomrdias 
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - new login flow with magic.link (not shipped but its working, need to finish migrations to not break our dev and staging envs)
    - support @gozala with new metadata design
    - bunch of js-ipfs request/issues/reviews
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - do we want to keep "Login with Github" or just migration users and remove it
- ⏭ Next:
    - finish existing users migration flow
    - reorganize repo to use cf pages for frontend and cf workers for api
    - wallet auth interactions

    - Wrap this up as a singe mega deal *today* ( yes I know it's super overdue )
    - Finish updating lotus fleet for upgrade tonight
