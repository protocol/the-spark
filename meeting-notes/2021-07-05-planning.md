# The Spark Planning 2021-07-05

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

## Async Updates

@jv (note not joining the call cuz 'murica, but want folks to have my update - using today to quietly burn down my backlog)
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Ramping Joao on design work
        - @joao - if you have qs plz ping me and i'll answer async today!
    - Iterating with Design / DAO to get us closer for implementation
        - See latest (including agata's design direction!) here: https://www.figma.com/file/826Zurcs6kgWSzQ35it966/web3.storage?node-id=79%3A448
    - Finding teams to work on a demo app for Flow using nft.storage
    - Wrangled notaries for our large datacap allocation: https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-plus-large-datasets/issues/12
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - Need finalization of what numbers we can quotes as SLA in our about page. 
        - Will follow up with mr. shaw tomorrow!
- ⏭ Next:
    - We're currently a little behind on the design side - high fi mocks are like 80% there, still missing some screens (less text / effort on those though)
        - Joao can hopefully get started on the first screens that are ready
    - This week workign more on copy. Pooja gave a heads up that she'll have opinions here when she's back, so expecting this to change
        - Existing plan lives here: https://www.notion.so/protocollabs/web3-storage-content-plan-e565c789d9a14bbb8399454316659f84
        - Will be working with Teri on entry points to the docs
    - Starting work on our launch blog post
    - Legal reviewing the tweaked ToS I shipped em
    - For @alanshaw
        - Coming out of the meeting with JB - it sounded like one potential action item was around doing: 
            - Durability threat model to help validate which of the above we’re most concerned about 1 node durability might be the real cause for concern -> if median replication is 10s, maybe we can calc the prob of an issue arising.
                - Is this something that's worth us doing? 
            - Changing the status api to enable users to see more information about how many nodes are pinning content vs. just saying pinned. 
                - What is the complexity here? Doable for the first iteration - or should we revisit in M2?
