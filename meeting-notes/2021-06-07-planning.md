### Current Projects

Planning for the projects we're actively working on.

#### [NFT.storage](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/99) (🚜) (@the-spark)

* CAR uploads (with user created CAR files via `ipfs-car` or similar)
* Support uploads larger than 100MB
    * pay to raise limit?
    * split large car into multi (more work for us)
        * does cluster support expiring pins? can it?
        * or upload the root first, and then associate partial CARs later?
            * riba says "it will work"™️
            * we lose meaningful 200 on the initial pin.
            * add an api to take cars but not pin. (dag import to)
            * (or an inbox)
            * @vasco to sketch estimate solution

* FaunaDB vs other options and make a plan - @hugomrdias & @gozala
