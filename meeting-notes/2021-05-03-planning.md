# The Spark Planning 2021-05-03

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

## Async Updates

    - Public checker API https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/nft.storage/pull/75
- ⏭ Next:
    - Refactor: pin tracking
        - Solves: Two NFTs may pin the same data
        - Enables public pin checker API
        - No double counts for data size
        - Quicker pin status and size followup cron job

@jnthnvctr
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Blog post with folks for launch day
    - Working with AS on next steps for nft.storage
- ⏭ Next:
    - Discuss timelines and open items: 
        - Supporting OpenSea and their decision making
            - CID client side upload
        - Ensuring Palm onboards properly
            - Clarify with Infura when / how Palm is going to integrate
                - Remote pinning?
            - Ensure Palm is integrating with theGraph
            - Ensure we've completed our ETH scraping and are in a position to scrape Palm
        - Ensuring we get backfills of ETH data
            - Scraping ETH
                - Requires large data import to work
                    - Requires cron job for Pinata pin checking
                    - Requires batch pinning from Cluster
            - Align with Pinata (and evenutally OpenSea) on strategy (proposed chatting with them Thurs/Fri)
        - Discuss strategy for metrics / robustification
            - How do we avoid bugs like the Github one / redirect one? 
            - How do we gather data on how people are using the service to answer qs about what's working?
            - User comms strategy?
    - BD side
        - AsyncArt
        - Follow ups with other platforms we've done outbound with
    - Feedback from JigStack
        - Some way of organizing pins within a single token (many collaborative devs, hard to parse the pins in the api)


@ribasushi
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - nft.storage:
       - Working dashboard updates
       - Ironed out extra IPFS node for pinning and dealmaking (separate to cluster)
       - Talked further with minerx fellows on Saturday regarding onboarding strategies / interface
    - sqlotus
       - Late into the pre-upgrade finally figured out a way around a relatively large performance issue before network reverted back to "normal"
       - Preliminary dirty workaround functional, proper re-implementation of the hot codepath almost ready
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - 🤢
- ⏭ Next:
     - nft.storage:
        - port the current ad-hoc sqlite datastore to a proper db incorporating all lessons learned, run a set of miner-self-service tests with select miners, onboarding remainder of public nft's in the process
     - sqlotus
        - wrap up refactor, restart real-time updates for sentinel

@gozala
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Implemented [chain scraper (take 2)](https://github.com/nftstorage/niftysave/pull/4)
        - [CRON execution log is stored in kv](https://dash.cloudflare.com/fffa4b4363a7e5250af8357087263b3a/workers/kv/namespaces/8bfdc339657d4c578043f7d7f2d1f909)
        - [Scraped NFT data in KV](https://dash.cloudflare.com/fffa4b4363a7e5250af8357087263b3a/workers/kv/namespaces/fcaab981736443c5b21957dfc0af5617)
        - [Scanner cursor state in KV](https://dash.cloudflare.com/fffa4b4363a7e5250af8357087263b3a/workers/kv/namespaces/1ed9f60450a848058b7c741996a43398)
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - [long tail of issues](https://protocollabs.slack.com/archives/C01MPC37Z37/p1619799384109400)
        - The Graph docs about pagination don't really hold up if you do sorting (like we do by block number)
        - Could not get CRON jobs to reliably spawn multiple workers (works in dev environment but times out in published version)
        - Need to sync with @alanshaw to figure out best compromise
- ⏭ Next:
    - Keep working on chain scraper until it's working reliably
