@ribasushi
* Separate into blockstore and chain tracking
* Debugging usage in Sentinel
* Create branch for Dinesh to take to Infura
    * Collect feedback, incorporate
* Finish off Instalotus PoC
* Finish off Lotus branch
    * Needs higher frequency chain head event system
    * Turn off some blockstore caches (not needed)
    * Figure out how to include this work as a build/config option (depends on Lotus team prefs)

Completion estimate:
* Instalotus (the PoC that uses Sqlotus) will be completed this week - March 26
* Sqlotus (the product that will be used by Sentinel, Infura etc.) will need ongoing integration and maintenance in 20% time
