# The Spark Planning 2021-04-19

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

## Async Updates

@alanshaw
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - WIP! Saving NFT's to nft.storage ([niftysave](https://github.com/nftstorage/niftysave)) - we now have worker processes for:
        - Storing nft assets i.e. extracting from metadata and pinning/uploading to nft.storage.
        - Saving NFT info to persistent storage i.e. the on-chain data, metadata.json and list of assets they link to and their pin status (for metrics and analytics, currently KV but will switch to PostgreSQL soon).
        - Following up on assets that are being pinned (so we know when we have fully pinned an NFT)
- ⏭ Next:
    - Switching nft.storage to using our own dedicated IPFS Cluster
    - niftysave orchestrator process

@ribasushi
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - Downloaded 99.5% of all Fleek NFTs ( background task is still pulling some of them, 3 extra rescued so far )
    - First properly batched set of several thousand NFT's available: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeic4ilqxhjkxrxn5gwsjhovg2ojml7ye7smnpbif3waw7kbrbrsfau/
        - Deals can be sent out already, but downloading became a problem, so semi-blocked on moving to Equinix
    - Upgrades of "shadow fleet" for V11
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - Blockage0
- ⏭ Next:
    - Retest download of offline car files with MinerX fellows / get deals flowing
    - Fix proto-sqlotus falling behind ( apparently this is now prod infra :man-facepalming: )
    - Firm up initial infra for dealmaking / get miners an initial self-service prototype ( very similar to fil-discover )
 

@gozala
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - We have a subgraph that we can query to get NFT data
        - https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/nftstorage/eip721-subgraph
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - On rotation this week
- ⏭ Next:
    - Need to submit a PR with my code that pulls data from the-graph and stores it into keybase
    - Turns some services e.g. zora use tokenURI for other things but created a derived contract with extra methods.
        - I was working on updgrading subgraph to account thoes too, but got little lost trying to understand how the contracts works


@hugomrdias 
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - magic.link auth with github and migration
