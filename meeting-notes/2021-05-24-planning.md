# The Spark Planning 2021-05-24

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

            - NFT info / gallery (which @pooja is working a separate PRD for)

@gozala
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - [Fauna DB for storing NFTs](https://dashboard.fauna.com/db/global/nft.storage)
        - Initially I went with processing tokens from cloudfare kv and putting new stuff into fauna, but that end up been worth of both worlds.
        - In the end switched to ingesting from the graph into fauna as at the end of the day it was pulling from one endpoint vs other.
        - Fauna impressions went from 🧐 -> 🙁 -> 😫 -> 🤬 -> 🤔 -> 😍
    - [cron job that pulls ERC-721 tokens into db](https://github.com/nftstorage/niftysave/actions/workflows/ERC-721.yml)
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - We should move fauna db to PL account.
    - Need to figure out how do we wire cloudfare with fauna db.
    - How do we upload assets to nft.storage (our APIs seem inadequate)
        - We could talk to cluster directly or have internal route to pin on both cluster and pinata
- ⏭ Next:
    - DB index to query queued/failed/succeeded tokenURI reads
        - Already deployed this morning (it is building an index now)
    - Cron job that attempts to fetch and parse metadata from tokenURIs (queries above index)
    - DB index to query queued/failed/succeeded assets
    - Cron job that pulls and pins token assets
    - DB index to query queued/failed/pinned tokens

@olizilla
- 🚢 Shipped:
    - ipfs-get - Get and verify a file by CID from an IPFS gateway over http (via .car) https://github.com/olizilla/ipfs-get
    - fix to not return base36 cidv0 converted cids in https://github.com/RangerMauve/js-ipfs-fetch/pull/5
- ⛔️ Blocked:
    - Open up /api/v0/dag/get on ipfs.io instead of waiting for go-ipfs v0.9.0 to land https://github.com/protocol/bifrost-infra/pull/1273
- ⏭ Next:
    - Publish ipfs-car (locally convert files to blocks n cids in a car file ready to be trustlessly POSTd to a gateway near you... that support /api/v0/dag/import or similar)
    - worked on ipfs-car with @vasco, just need to publish. it's ipld car + unixfs - Convert files to content-addressable archives and back.
    - ipfs-car in the browser!
    - Add more ideas to the future of gateways plan in https://www.notion.so/protocollabs/IPFS-in-JavaScript-888c7f1ecdde4330aa3fc9f5a66cff00
