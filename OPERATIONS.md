# Operations

These are the working arrangements for The Spark. Please PR to improve!

## Daily

On a daily basis we aim to perform the following tasks:

### Async updates

Add an async update to The Spark's slack channel `#w3dt-the-spark`. Prefix the message with ⚡️ to differentiate it from other messages.

## Weekly

Every week we do the following:

### Demo time

We attend a private w3dt "demo time" **every Friday @ 17:00 UTC (09:00 PT)** ([Sign up form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U8QQXoniCjZzZo6i_H32Lc8ziuE5BL2V_58nc-T-Cc4)). Most recorded demos are published to [slate](https://slate.host/alanshaw/the-spark-demos) and YouTube:

* [FIL Demos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_0VrY55uV1_NtdimsD2mncnL6__b1x6T)
* [IPFS Demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuhRWgmPaHtRRtDPxOcE9cR2yDqvqLdCr)
* [PL Demos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhuBigpl7lqs6QcAuIvCJ9-SIa8G9yujJ)

Demos should be 5-10 minutes.

> This enables full focus on Tue/Wed/Thurs, hopefully yielding something to show by Friday.

### Planning

We have a planning meeting **every Monday @ 16:00 UTC (08:00 PT)**. We'll not record these, but they're publically available for anyone to join.

> Planning on Monday helps us focus on the right things to do for the week.

We use a HackMD notepad for collaborative meeting notes. An issue is opened on the [repo](https://github.com/protocol/the-spark) after each meeting with a new a notepad URL for the next. After each meeting the notes document is [added to the team repo](https://github.com/protocol/the-spark/tree/main/meeting-notes).

Async prep:

1. List of things you shipped 🚢 (NOT everything you worked on - this is done throughout the week async. It is FINE to not have anything in this section).
2. List of things you're blocked on.
3. Proposals for things to work on next.
4. Add the project(s) you're working on to the list for discussion.

Meeting notes template:

```markdown
# The Spark Planning YYYY-MM-DD

## Agenda

1. Async updates: participants broadcast their own async update and answer any questions.
2. Current projects: review and assign tasks for the next week.
3. Project pitches: review status and next steps if there are changes.
4. Open discussion for any other questions that arise.

## Notes/Questions

General notes and/or questions go here.
```

In the meeting we:

1. Congratulate each other on the things we ship 👏.
2. Determine ways forward for blockages.
3. Discuss each project and it's next steps (the plan for the week).
    * This might be a case of copying over proposed next steps to the relevant sections, but we may decide to alter the course as we discuss.
4. Answer any questions that come up.

## General

### CoLo

We have a (virtual) colo room open 24/7 for team members to use for sync chats.

### Project Pitch/Project work

Aim to allocate up to 50% of your time to pitches (this includes research) and the remainder to actual project implementations.

Project work should not take > 4 weeks.

### Scratch space

Each member has a [home directory in the repo](https://github.com/protocol/the-spark/tree/main/home) they can use for notes/code/whatever. You're encouraged to use this space as much as possible.
